Uses JS code that creates Pacman each time a button is clicked in conjuction with HTML.

## <ins>How to Run

Load page and click the Add PacMan button in the top left hand corner to add a pacman then click the Start Game button to make them move.  Add as many Pacmen as you like and click the Start Game button to make them move faster.  Reload browser to restart from zero Pacmen.

## <ins>Future improvements

Future improvements would be to add a switch statement and random feature to add different size and color Pacmen with the button Click and add a reset button instead of having to reload the browser to reset the game.
